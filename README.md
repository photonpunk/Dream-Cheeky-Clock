Dream-Cheeky-Clock
==================

Must also have the following open source files installed: https://dreamcheekyusb.codeplex.com/

Every few seconds the script checks the time on the local system and changes the led’s color 
depending on the hour; slowly working it’s way up roygbiv. So the later in the day it is, the 
further up on the color spectrum it’s glowing, cycling every 12 hours. I also set it to blink 
the hour. So if it were 3:00, it would slowly fade in and out once, and then blink rapidly 
three times.
